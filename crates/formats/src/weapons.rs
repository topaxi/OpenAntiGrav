//! `WeaponStats_*.xml`: the weapon table, the disturber odds and the pickup
//! distribution.
//!
//! Weapons in Pulse are **data, not code**, the same way ship handling is. Two
//! files carry the whole system - [`RACE_ENTRY`] for the ordinary modes and
//! [`ELIMINATION_ENTRY`] for Eliminator - and `WeaponStats_Parse` (`0x0880db7c`)
//! reads both through one parser, so a mode swaps the table wholesale rather
//! than patching it.
//!
//! ```text
//! <WeaponStats>
//!   <Weapon type="Global">    <Stats slowdown_limit/> </Weapon>
//!   <Weapon type="Turbo">     <Stats absorb time/>    </Weapon>
//!   ...                                                     x14
//!   <DisturberOdds>
//!     <Weapon type="Rocket"> <Odds .../> <Times .../> </Weapon>
//!     ...
//!   </DisturberOdds>
//!   <Pickupodds class="Venom">
//!     <Weapon type="Autopilot"> <Stats ai back front human/> </Weapon>
//!     ...
//!   </Pickupodds>                                            x4
//! </WeaponStats>
//! ```
//!
//! The schema and the per-weapon parser addresses are in
//! `docs/formats/weapon-stats.md`.
//!
//! # What this decodes, and what it names without decoding
//!
//! The same principle [`crate::handling`] states: only what a consumer exists
//! for. Concretely:
//!
//! - **The three weapons that damage nobody** - Turbo, Shield and Autopilot -
//!   in full. They share one two-attribute schema and are the three that need
//!   no projectile, no target and no AI to be worth building.
//! - **`absorb` for every weapon**, because it is the one attribute all fourteen
//!   carry and it is what `Ship_Damage`'s absorb branch spends
//!   (`docs/ghidra/functions/psp-pulse-usa/shield.md`).
//! - **`<Pickupodds>` in full**, because it *is* the pickup system's design:
//!   what a pad hands out, weighted per speed class and separately for AI,
//!   human, front and back of the grid.
//! - **`<Global>`'s `slowdown_limit`**.
//!
//! Everything else - blast radii, projectile speeds, lock distances, the seven
//! disturber effects - is named on `docs/formats/weapon-stats.md` and left
//! undecoded, because nothing fires a projectile yet and a field decoded with no
//! consumer is a field nobody has checked.
//!
//! # Nothing here defaults
//!
//! An attribute the schema lists is required, and a missing one is an [`Error`]
//! rather than a zero, for the reason [`crate::handling`] gives at length: a
//! quietly-zero `time` is a shield that expires immediately, which reads as a
//! gameplay bug rather than as a parse failure.
//!
//! A weapon the file does not author at all is a different thing and is not an
//! error - [`WeaponStats::simple`] returns `None`. The two Eliminator and Race
//! files need not carry the same set.
