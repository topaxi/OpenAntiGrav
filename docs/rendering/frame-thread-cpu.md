# The frame thread's CPU: where a race frame spends it (2026-10-21)

The Steam Deck's perf meter shows `CPU` 8 to 10 ms on a paused race, with `PRESENT` 8 ms and
`OUTSIDE` 0.7 ms. `CPU`, `PRESENT` and `OUTSIDE` partition the frame (see
`crates/present/src/perf/cost.rs`), so the frame thread is busy for most of a 60 Hz frame while
no tick runs. This page is what was measured on a desktop host and what is still open for the
Deck. Evidence is ratios and shares; the host is several times faster than the Deck's Zen 2.

## How to read it: `--frame-log` now prints a phase line

`oag-game --frame-log` (or `OAG_FRAME_LOG=1`) prints one extra line a second before the
frame-log line, `frame-phases`, with the mean milliseconds per frame of each stretch of the
frame thread (`crates/game/src/main/session/phases.rs`). They add up to `total`, which sits close
to `cpu_ms` plus `present_ms` less the acquire wait (the acquire, `draw_screens` and the
end-of-frame bookkeeping are outside the phases):

| Phase | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| `ticks` | the fixed-step ticks and the stage update |
| `prep` | end-race flow and `begin_scene_frame` |
| `setup` | `draw` up to the stage dispatch: view, encoder, target sizing |
| `scene` | the stage's drawing into the encoder: for a race, the scene record |
| `compose` | HUD, bloom composite, menu and upscale passes |
| `overlay` | perf overlay, cursor, timestamp resolves |
| `submit` | `encoder.finish()` and `Queue::submit` (wgpu-core validation and tracking) |
| `readback` | mapping last frame's timestamps, feeding the resolution controller |
| `present` | `Queue::present` |

The stage name reads `race-paused` while the pause rule freezes the race (`--race` starts
frozen, a `start` tap in `--script` releases it).

## What was measured

Headless gamescope at 1280x800 on the host's RX 7800 XT, release build, `--race --autopilot
--no-audio --frame-log`, load average 16 to 22 (wall-clock milliseconds are not comparable with
the Deck's; the shares are). Command:
`gamescope --backend headless -W 1280 -H 800 -w 1280 -h 800 -r 60 -- oag-game <image> --race
--autopilot --no-audio --frame-log --script "12:quit"` (add `3:start,` for racing).

Share of the frame thread's CPU, **paused**, before any change (three runs, `total` 1.2 to 1.5 ms
on Pulse, 1.5 to 1.9 ms on HD):

| Phase | Pulse | HD/Fury |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `submit` (finish and submit) | 47 % | 58 % |
| `scene` (record) | 32 % | 25 % |
| `present` | 13 % | 10 % |
| `compose` | 3 % | 3 % |
| everything else | 5 % | 4 % |

- **A paused frame costs nearly what a racing one does.** Pulse paused `total` 1.26 ms against
  1.86 ms racing; HD 1.87 against 2.02. The ticks are 0.01 ms either way: the cost is the draw,
  not the simulation.
- **Draw count drives it.** The whole-race bench (`just bench-render pulse hd`) p50: Pulse 321
  draws, `record_us` 848, `submit_us` 420; HD 617 draws, `record_us` 1,015, `submit_us` 1,181.
- **Submit is wgpu-core, not our code.** A flat profile of the frame thread (perf, no call
  graph; the dwarf call graph does not unwind through the Mesa driver) puts wgpu-core's
  command-buffer work at the top: `encode_render_pass`, `TextureUsageScope::merge_single`,
  `BufferUsageScope::clear`, and `CommandBufferTextureMemoryActions::register_init_action` with
  a `Vec::retain` on `TextureSurfaceDiscard` (an init action per bound texture per pass, the
  bindless texture arrays making that long). RADV and the kernel's DRM ioctls are another
  third of the thread; our own `oag_*` code is about a fifth.
- **The GPU is not what the CPU row waits on, on this host.** Raising the render target from
  1280x725 to 7624x4320 (gpu_ms 0.36 to 3.6) moved `cpu_ms` from 2.5 to 3.8 on the same run.
  The Deck's GPU is far slower, and a shared-memory APU can stall a `write_buffer` or a submit
  on the GPU's use of the same memory. That cannot be seen from here; see the handover.
- **The build is the same.** The Deck builds in `docs/rendering/hd-gpu-cost.md` and
  `docs/tools/packaging.md` are release builds (`perf-probe`, `znver2`). `perf-probe` adds
  counters on the frame path (allocation counting, write tallies), not wgpu validation; this
  host's profile was the default release, which has the same wgpu-core validation.

## What changed (one commit each, no pixel change)

1. **`shine::TrackNormals`** turned every circuit vertex's normal again on each new clock value
   when the circuit has any animated node (Pulse's do). It now turns only the vertices that ride
   a node; the rest are placed once. Bit-identical arithmetic per vertex. It was 9 % of the whole
   bench thread's samples. Pulse bench `cpu_us` p50 1,277 to 1,074 and 1,111 us (two runs; the
   same build run twice differs by 3.5 %), `record_us` 848 to 712. HD has no animated circuit
   shine, no change.
2. **Animation tables and hull shine coordinates are written only when their inputs moved.**
   `Drawable::write_anims`/`write_node_anims` are functions of the race clock; a paused race, or a
   second frame inside one tick, wrote identical bytes. `write_environment_map` is a function of
   the craft's pose and flaps. Each now remembers what it last wrote. Paused `scene` phase on
   Pulse 0.40 to 0.27 ms (three interleaved before/after runs), on HD 0.45 to 0.31 ms. Racing
   frames are unaffected by this one (the clock moves each tick).

Both leave screenshots byte-identical (`cmp` of `--screenshot` at 1, 400 and 1500 ticks on Pulse,
HD and Pure). Neither is in a simulation crate.

The sum is about 0.15 ms of 1.2 to 1.5 on this host, about a tenth of a paused frame. It does
not explain a Deck `CPU` of 8 to 10 ms by itself.

## Dropped or not done

- Memoising the wgpu work itself is not possible from here: `submit` is wgpu-core walking the
  recorded passes. The levers are fewer draws and passes, or render bundles, neither a no-pixel-
  change quick fix.
- GPU timestamp rows for the untimed passes (shadow, particles, HUD overlay, composite) were not
  added: on this host `gpu_ms` is 0.3 to 0.9 ms and `frame-phases` already shows the CPU side, so
  the open question is the Deck's, and the handover thread lists what to read there.

## Cross-title

The changes are in `oag-render` and `oag-raceplay`'s drawables, which every title shares. Pulse
and Pure share the Pulse path; HD, Omega and 2048 use the same drawables. Measured on Pulse and
HD only; the screenshots were also compared on Pure.
