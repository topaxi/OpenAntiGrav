# HD's effectSettings load path is found; what it does with the file is blocked on the TOC defect

`EBOOT.elf` (Wipeout HD/Fury, PS3), image base `0x00000000`. Found while
chasing `docs/formats/effectsettings.md`'s open question of what selects a
Zone stage at runtime, from the HD side - 2048's own `Zone_UpdateStage`
(`docs/ghidra/functions/vita-2048-eu-v104/zone-environment-fallback.md`) is a
different executable and does not answer this for HD.

**No confidence-50+ claim is made here about what the load does past the
call site.** Everything below is either TOC-verified fact (manual OPD lookup,
not Ghidra's own resolution) or explicitly marked unresolved. Nothing is
renamed this pass.

## HD's own four effectSettings strings

```
0x007b3e08  Data/Environments/DetonatorModeDLC3.effectSettings
0x007b3e40  Data/Environments/ZoneModeDLC3.effectSettings
0x007b3e70  Data/Environments/DetonatorMode.effectSettings
0x007b3ea0  Data/Environments/ZoneMode.effectSettings
```

Found via `search_strings` with no `program` parameter (see the tooling trap
below - passing one is unreliable here). Plain `Data/Environments/` paths,
unlike the `data/ZoneEnvironmentHDFury/...` naming 2048's own fallback code
constructs when reaching for these same four files
(`docs/ghidra/functions/vita-2048-eu-v104/zone-environment-fallback.md`) -
that prefix is 2048's own invention for referring to HD's files, not
something HD's own executable uses for itself.

Each string sits behind its own global `char*` slot in a data region at
`0x008b8100`-`0x008b8130`, interleaved with unrelated globals (some other
pointers, at least one IEEE-754 float `1.0f`) - four adjacent declarations
the linker happened to place together, not an isolated four-entry table.
`ZoneMode.effectSettings`'s own slot is `0x008b8120`.

## `FUN_003f3fb0` loads it - TOC-verified, and independently corroborated

`FUN_003f3fb0` is not a fresh lead: `docs/formats/envsettings.md`'s own
"Where the executable touches this" section already names it (before this
session) as a large per-race setup function that also loads `"sky.gtf"`,
`"skycube"` and `"Data/Tex/ZoneSky.gtf"` - i.e. already independently
identified as environment/scene setup, from a different investigation
entirely. This session adds a second, TOC-verified data point rather than
starting cold:

1. `search_instructions(mnemonic: lwz, operand_pattern: 52a4)` found
   `lwz r3, -0x52a4(r2)` at `0x003f4140`, inside `FUN_003f3fb0`.
2. `FUN_003f3fb0`'s own OPD entry (`search_byte_patterns` for its address,
   then reading the `{func, toc}` pair `docs/ghidra/functions/ps3-hdfury-eu/memory.md`
   describes) gives its real TOC as **`0x008bd3c4`** - the *second* of the
   binary's two TOCs, not the one Ghidra assumes for everything.
3. `0x008bd3c4 - 0x52a4 = 0x008b8120` - **exactly** the `ZoneMode.effectSettings`
   string's own global slot, computed by hand rather than trusted from
   Ghidra's decompiled variable name (which would show a different, wrong
   global under its own assumed TOC).
4. The very next instruction, `0x003f4144`, is `bl 0x003d6dc8` - a direct
   call, passing the loaded string pointer as `FUN_003d6dc8`'s sole argument
   (`r3`). Call targets are absolute/PC-relative, not TOC-relative, so this
   part of the chain is unaffected by the TOC question.

So: **`FUN_003f3fb0` reads `ZoneMode.effectSettings`'s path and hands it to
`FUN_003d6dc8`.** This much is fact, not inference - two independent
verifications (manual OPD math, and a prior session's unrelated
identification of this same function as environment setup) agree.

## What `FUN_003d6dc8` actually does with it: blocked

`FUN_003d6dc8`'s own OPD entry was checked the same way: its real TOC is
**also `0x008bd3c4`**, not Ghidra's assumed `0x008ad4d8`. Its full decompile
was pulled anyway, and reads as HUD `SpeedBar`/`SpeedBarText`/
`OpponentTargetZone` widget setup - but **that reading is not trustworthy**.
Every symbolic name in it is Ghidra's resolution under the wrong TOC, which
is precisely the failure mode `memory.md` documents with its own worked
example (`FwMemHeap_Create`'s report string reading as `"forward"` under the
wrong TOC and the real string, correctly, under the right one). There is no
reason to expect this function's dozens of TOC-relative loads land on the
right globals by chance, and "coincidentally looks like a real subsystem"
(HUD widgets are a plausible thing for *some* function in this binary to
touch) is exactly how a wrong reading survives review.

**Closing this needs one of two things, neither attempted here**:

1. Re-run `scripts/import-ps3-eboot.sh` (which now includes
   `AssignPs3R2FromOpd.java` per `memory.md`) to fix TOC assignment across
   the whole database - a whole-project action, not something to do
   speculatively mid-investigation without the maintainer's say-so, since it
   touches every function's applied names.
2. Manually verify every one of `FUN_003d6dc8`'s TOC-relative loads by hand,
   the way the two loads above were - realistic for one or two instructions,
   not for a ~400-line function.

## A new trap: byte-pattern search across a TOC boundary

Worth recording because it cost real time this pass and will cost it again.
`search_instructions`/`search_byte_patterns` match on **raw encoded bytes**,
which is TOC-blind: the same `-0x52a4(r2)` displacement appears in multiple
functions, and each one's *real* target depends on **that function's own**
TOC, not a shared one. Two hits from the same byte-pattern search in this
pass:

- `FUN_003f3fb0` (TOC `0x008bd3c4`): `-0x52a4(r2)` resolves to `0x008b8120`,
  the `ZoneMode.effectSettings` string - the lead this page is about.
- `FUN_000b6b98` (TOC `0x008ad4d8`, confirmed via its own OPD entry): the
  *same* `-0x52a4(r2)` displacement resolves to `0x008a8234` - a completely
  unrelated global, one of two lookup tables `FUN_000b6b98` itself indexes
  by a field at `PTR_DAT_008a822c + 0xd4` to write a float at some object's
  `+0x160`. Initially treated as a second lead into this same mechanism; it
  is not. Ruled out only by checking its OPD entry directly, the way
  `memory.md`'s own three-step method requires - the operand text alone
  (`"-0x52a4(r2)"`, identical in both hits) cannot tell the two apart.

**So a byte-pattern/instruction search across this binary needs its own
per-hit OPD check before any hit is trusted**, the same way a string xref
already does - `memory.md`'s warning covers string cross-references
specifically, and this extends the same caution to instruction/byte-pattern
searches for the same underlying reason.

## What this settles and what it does not

- **Settles**: HD's own executable does read its `ZoneMode.effectSettings`
  path, from a function independently corroborated as per-race environment
  setup by two unrelated investigations. The load site and its immediate
  call target are fact, not inference.
- **Does not settle**: what `FUN_003d6dc8` does with the string - parse it,
  open it, thread it through as an opaque token, or something else. No
  stage-selection field (2048's `+0x634` equivalent) was found on the HD
  side; the trail into `FUN_003d6dc8` is exactly where it stops.
- **Does not settle**: whether HD's own selection mechanism looks anything
  like 2048's `Zone_UpdateStage` (a clamped, cross-faded per-craft field).
  Nothing here reaches far enough to compare.

## 2026-08-28: the TOC defect is fixed project-wide; `FUN_003d6dc8` redecompiled

The maintainer re-ran `scripts/import-ps3-eboot.sh --ps3-cspec`, closing the
whole-project blocker option 1 above named. Verified directly through the
live bridge rather than trusted from the script's own output: the program
now reports language `PowerPC:BE:64:A2ALT-32addr-PS3` (not the old
`-32addr`), still 26,100 functions, real imports (`cellFsClose`,
`sys_lwmutex_lock`, ...). `scripts/apply-ghidra-names.py` re-applied all 114
rows of this binary's `names.tsv` clean (0 skipped, 0 failed) and the program
was saved.

**`FUN_003d6dc8` no longer reads as `SpeedBar`/HUD widget setup.** That
reading is not being directly diffed against a saved copy of the old
decompile, but it depended entirely on TOC-relative loads this page already
established were resolving against the wrong TOC - so a completely different
shape on redecompile is consistent with the earlier reading being exactly
the artifact `memory.md` warns about, not a second data point confirming it.

**What the new decompile actually shows, not yet confidence-scored or
renamed**: no `SpeedBar` shape at all. Instead:

- A loop of exactly **fifteen** iterations, pairing two objects per
  iteration from two arrays based at `iVar8 + 0x33b8` and `iVar8 + 0x346c` -
  the same count as HD's own `zonemode.effectsettings` stage ladder
  (`docs/formats/effectsettings.md`), for whatever that is worth before the
  objects themselves are identified.
- Several texture/render-target allocations through what reads as a texture
  constructor (`_opd_FUN_005a6ce0`, called with width/height/format-shaped
  arguments): `0x200 x 0x200`, `0x20 x 0x20`, `0x100 x 1`.
- A **64-entry palette unpacked from 3-byte RGB triples** (`(uint)*pbVar16 +
  (uint)pbVar16[1] * 0x100 + (uint)pbVar16[2] * 0x10000`, looped 0x40 times)
  read from a stack-relative address - plausible fit for a colour ramp or
  gradient LUT, unconfirmed.
- Repeated calls to a pair of functions, `_opd_FUN_005dde98` (five
  arguments, one of them an address inside what looks like a second implicit
  parameter) and `_opd_FUN_005d91a8` (called with no visible arguments in
  several call sites, which is itself suspicious - see below) - a plausible
  shape for "hash this key name, look it up in the parsed effectSettings
  table, return a float", exactly what fifteen stage-keyed colour blocks
  would need, but this is a hypothesis from shape alone, not traced.

**Two concrete blockers before any of this can be named**, both `_q`-below-50
territory right now:

1. `iStack_24f4` is read throughout (`*(int *)(iStack_24f4 + -0x58d0)` etc.)
   but never assigned inside this decompile - Ghidra inferred a one-parameter
   signature (`param_1` alone), so this is almost certainly a second,
   stack-passed parameter the auto-analysis missed, not a real stack
   variable. Needs `get_function_variables`/`set_function_prototype` to
   restore the real signature before the `-0x58xx` offsets mean anything.
2. `_opd_FUN_005dde98`/`_opd_FUN_005d91a8` are themselves undecoded - the
   "hash + lookup" reading is pattern-matched from the call shape and the
   stage count matching, not from either function's own body.

**Next step for whoever picks this up**: fix `FUN_003d6dc8`'s prototype
first (resolves what `iStack_24f4` actually is), then decompile
`_opd_FUN_005dde98`/`_opd_FUN_005d91a8` under their own (now-correct) TOCs -
same OPD-verification discipline this page has used throughout, since the
project-wide fix does not exempt any individual function from that check,
it just makes Ghidra's own resolution trustworthy again.

## Tooling note: `program` parameter is unreliable across the two PS3/Vita programs

Passing `program: "EBOOT.elf"` explicitly to `search_strings` and
`search_functions_enhanced` silently returned results from the *other* open
program (`eboot.elf`, 2048's Vita executable) despite `switch_program` having
already made `EBOOT.elf` current and `get_current_program_info` confirming
it. Omitting `program` entirely (relying on the already-switched "current"
program) gave correct results both times. Verified directly:
`search_strings(program: "EBOOT.elf", search_term: "effectsettings")`
returned 2048's six strings; the identical call with `program` omitted
returned HD's own four. Whoever continues this thread on either binary:
**omit `program` and verify with `get_current_program_info` first**, rather
than trusting the parameter.
