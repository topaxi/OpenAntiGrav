# HD's sprite flare reads oversized against the original, and the tuning file's other 19 rows are read

2026-09-01. Started from a user report from play: the exhaust flare "too
big/too far out", with the trail also suspected. Confirmed the first half
with a matched-ish screenshot pair rather than guesswork -
`data/reference/hd-capture/flare-size/` holds `original-rpcs3.png` (a driven
Talon's Junction lap via `scripts/rpcs3-drive.py race --drive 15 --shots`)
against `ours.png` (`just play hd --race --press cross --ticks 300`), same
track and a comparable chase framing. The original's core is a compact glow
at each nozzle, narrower than the hull; this engine's is one white disc
spanning past both nozzles, roughly hull-width. Full writeup, including what
was ruled out (a second locator, the constants themselves) and the six
tuning-file rows read for the first time (`Flare Highlight Power/Boost`,
`Flare Size Clamp`, `Engine Flare Particles Min Alpha`/`Enable`, on top of
confirming `Spikes Thrust/Boost Max Scale` and `Shockwave Cycle Speed` stay
unread) is on
[engine-trail.md](../docs/ghidra/functions/ps3-hdfury-eu/engine-trail.md),
"All 41 rows, read 2026-09-01".

**Why this isn't a code change yet.** `Flare Fadeout Dist`/`Range` (15.0
world units each) is the leading candidate - a near/far fade landing "small
at ordinary chase distance" matches both screenshots - but it is a reading
of two numbers, not a traced consumer, and `hd.rs`'s existing doc already
flagged the same shader pair (`engineflare_vp`/`fp`) as unresolved through
the registry script two sessions ago. Writing a fade curve to fit two
screenshots is exactly the invented-stand-in shape CLAUDE.md rules out, so
`hd::Sprite`'s radius law is untouched. Two static leads were run down and
closed rather than followed further: `EngineFlare_Init`'s `+0xe4`/`+0x144`
writes are never read inside `EngineFlare_PlaceShapes` or
`EngineFlare_Update` (grepped both functions' full decompile), and the
function sitting between `EngineFlare_Init` and `EngineFlare_PlaceShapes` in
address order (`FUN_002a17e8`) turned out to be the engine-sound cue state
machine, not a draw call. The function that actually turns `Flare Radius`
into a world-space quad is still unlocated.

**2026-09-01, a second session pushed further on this specifically and still
did not find it - full account on engine-trail.md ("What two sessions'
worth of reading could not settle").** A correction first: `+0xe4` is not
radius storage, it is the exhaust intensity field - decompiling
`EngineFlare_Update` in full (not done in the first pass) shows it ramped
0.25/s up, 0.5/s down, clamped `[0, 1]`, the wrong range for a 2-3-unit
radius. `Flare Size Clamp` and `Engine Flare Particles`
(from the first session's read) are still unread past the tuning file.

Then a live pass: `scripts/hd-flare-sprite-dump.py` dumps the whole
`EngineFlare` object and flags every 4-byte word in RSX range
(`0xC0000000..0xD0000000`), reasoning that the sprite's own vertex buffer
would settle the true half-size independent of the still-open camera
problem. It found six such pointers (`+0x70`/`0x74` a pair, `+0xb8` static,
`+0x1f0`/`0x1f4` duplicated at `+0x230`/`0x234`, `+0x240` single) but every
one reads back near-all-zero - not plausible vertex positions. Best
reading: occlusion-query result buffers (double/triple-buffered for
readback latency), matching the still-unread `Flare Occluder Radius`/
`Flare Depth Bias`. `Billboard.cpp` (found via the `__FILE__` attribution
trick) was also checked and ruled out - track sponsor signage, unrelated.
Artefacts (the object dump, the six candidate buffers, the meta) are under
`data/reference/hd-capture/flare-size/sprite-dump/`.

**2026-09-02, a third session found the draw call - full account on
engine-trail.md ("Third session: it was on `EngineFlare`'s own vtable, not a
separate manager").** Neither of the two untried angles the second session
left open was quite it: not a separate manager object, and no pushbuffer scan
was needed. `EngineFlare`'s own vtable (`0x00869d30`) has two class-specific
slots besides `EngineFlare_Update` that neither prior session had opened -
slot 5 and slot 7, the identical two slots `TrailEffectManager`'s vtable uses
for `Trail_Enqueue`/`Trail_RenderTick`. Read live off the vtable (8-byte OPD
stride, no symbol to decompile from since neither had a name yet): slot 5 is
`EngineFlare_Enqueue` (`0x002a06e0`, confidence 84 - byte-for-byte
`Trail_Enqueue`'s own function, confirmed to write into the *same* render-queue
object via two different TOC slots holding an identical pointer value); slot 7
is `EngineFlare_RenderTick` (`0x002a08a8`, confidence 78 - gated on a flag in
the same shared per-frame global `Trail_RenderTick` also gates on, at a
different byte offset, and reaching `Rsx_SetMethod` through a chain of
TOC-fixup trampolines). This is the missing consumer. What it does not yet
settle: which of its loads is `Flare Radius` itself - most of the function's
body past the gate is RSX submission plumbing, not the tuning values.

## Open

- **The sprite's draw call is now located: `EngineFlare_RenderTick`
  (`0x002a08a8`, confidence 78, on `EngineFlare`'s own vtable - see
  engine-trail.md).** What remains open is narrower than "find the consumer":
  which of `EngineFlare_RenderTick`'s loads corresponds to `Flare Radius` /
  `Flare Radius Min` / `Max Radius Jitter`, and separately to
  `Flare Fadeout Dist/Range` and `Flare Size Clamp`. The function is long
  (`0x002a08a8`-`0x002a1500`+) and most of it past its per-frame gate is RSX
  vertex/state submission (a chain of TOC-fixup trampolines reaching
  `Rsx_SetMethod` and several not-yet-named helpers in the
  `0x005a4000`-`0x005f1000` region) rather than the tuning reads themselves -
  not yet traced to the specific float that becomes the quad's half-size.
- `Flare Fadeout Dist`/`Range` (15.0/15.0): whether a near/far fade is what
  is missing, and if so its curve - linear, smoothstep, or something else -
  is unread. The leading candidate for the oversized-flare finding, but
  unverified.
- `Flare Size Clamp` (50.0): newly named, unread past the tuning file. The
  order-of-magnitude gap against `Flare Radius` (3.0) suggests it clamps
  something other than a raw world half-size, but that is a hypothesis from
  the numbers alone.
- `Engine Flare Particles` (`Enable`, `Min Alpha` 0.25): a third flare
  component distinct from the always-on flame model and the sprite, neither
  of which this project draws. The small bright dashes trailing under the
  nozzle in `original-rpcs3.png` are the leading candidate for what this
  is. No `.pob` or emitter table has been matched to it.
- `Flare Highlight Power`/`Boost` (32.0/1.0), `Spikes Thrust/Boost Max
  Scale` (1.5/2.0), `Shockwave Cycle Speed` (0.01): named, unread.
- The trail itself is also suspected inaccurate per the user's report.
  **Checked and refuted**: a separate HD-vs-Fury trail asset (no - one
  asset, disc-wide, colour-mixed by the already-implemented `engineTrail`
  parameter) and a Zone-specific trail material (no - neither the trail's
  nor the flame's material declares any of the 16 known zone-parameter
  hashes). See "Checked: no separate trail for HD vs. Fury" on
  engine-trail.md. If the trail still reads wrong in Zone specifically, the
  live candidate is HD's still-unlocated Zone environment recolour
  ([zone-effectsettings-loader.md](../docs/ghidra/functions/ps3-hdfury-eu/zone-effectsettings-loader.md))
  reaching ships too, not a second trail asset - unconfirmed either way.

## Next Steps

- Trace `EngineFlare_RenderTick` (`0x002a08a8`) past its per-frame gate to
  find which load is the quad half-size. It reads a dozen floats out of the
  shared render-frame global at `0x00aea540` (`+0x470`..`+0x4a8`,
  unidentified past "shared state") before reaching the RSX submission
  chain - one of those, or a field read later in the function past what this
  session decompiled, is the candidate. A live read (breakpoint or memory
  poll while the sprite is on screen, the way `hd-flare-sprite-dump.py`
  polled the object) on the function's float registers at the point it
  builds the quad corners would settle it faster than more static reading -
  runtime verification is worth more than any amount of decompiling per the
  [confidence rubric](../docs/reverse-engineering/confidence-rubric.md).
- Once the consumer's radius math is read, either confirm and implement the
  `Flare Fadeout Dist/Range` law or find what actually scales the sprite.
- Separately assess the trail's own accuracy against the original, per the
  user's report - not investigated this session.
