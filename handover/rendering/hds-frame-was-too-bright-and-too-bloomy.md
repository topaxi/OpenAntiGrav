# HD's frame was too bright and too bloomy; the bloom chain was not what was wrong

2026-08-20, **resolved**. The RE is in [renderer.md](../../docs/ghidra/functions/ps3-hdfury-eu/renderer.md) - "runs on 8-bit surfaces", "The 14 surface binds", "The lit track material", "The vertex-light constants", "Ships have no Lambert diffuse". This row keeps only what is not there. **Method**: `--race --ticks 0 --screenshot` at 1440x816 against two rpcs3 grabs at 1280x720 - **close framings, not identical, so aggregates only, never a pixel diff**. **The metric that discriminates is clipped-white share** (all channels >= 250), *not* mean luminance, which matched the reference throughout and is why the defect survived review. **Ablation table**, clipped-white %: baseline **16.5**; scene clamped to `[0,1]` **14.25**; chain in gamma space **17.4**; specular removed **14.8**; bloom removed **4.9**; scene / 4 **0.85**; `scaleAdd` 0.25 **10.7**; no-lightmap placeholder alpha zeroed **9.08**. Reference **5.8 / 7.3**. **Shipped**: the 8-bit surface clamp, the invented `sun * (ndl * baked.a)` diffuse summand removed, and the per-vertex light decoded and added. 16.5 -> **10.20 %**, mean 0.583 -> **0.497** against 0.585. **The mean is the part still wrong**, and it is the honest kind: what is missing is a material, not a light. **Do not tune the chain** - `alpha_contribution`, the exposure constants and `scaleAdd` are each read off the disc and each was verified. **Findings that live only here.** (a) The **sampled lightmap is bimodal on screen**: 67 % pure black (only 85 materials name an `lmaps/*-lmap.gtf`) and 10 % blown white in hard-edged rectangles, so an exponent changes nothing, and removing its sRGB decode moves the frame **0.00** points. (b) **`-lmap.gtf` files are not shadow maps** but 1024x1024 full-colour baked atlases, ~28 per circuit. (c) **The attribute census**: of 983 chunks, **327 declare `lightmapUV` and no colour set, 351 the reverse, 0 both**, 305 neither. **Three negatives, so nobody re-runs them.** (1) Forcing the glow mask's alpha to 0.0 gives a **byte-identical PNG** - `GlowMask::Protected` already masks it off. (2) The colour set as a *multiplied* tint lands good aggregates and **blacks out the banners and the hull**: it is added, not multiplied. (3) The disc's RGBE decode on that colour set yields ~1e-39 and blacks the frame - it is real but reads `SpuVertexColours`, which **no `.rcsmodel` declares** (0 of 123). **Verification**: `just test-data` - all **149 render-touching ground truths pass**; the single failure, `stall_rescue_ground_truth::a_craft_that_stops_on_the_disc_is_put_back`, **fails identically on a clean tree** and is physics. **Still open**: whether those 8 bits hold linear or gamma light (nothing in the executable gamma-encodes; confidence 70 against ADR-0026, not acted on, and the obvious tiebreaker does not discriminate); whether `0x1aaf7631` and `colorSet1` are one attribute; what the colour set's fourth byte gates; and `shadowMapTex`, which the disc projects and we have none of. **On the report of missing geometry at the start line**: not missing - blown-white track surface. The 56 unaddressed nodes are four 2-unit cambots plus sky traffic whose chunks live in **other circuits'** `.rcsmodel` files.

2026-09-06: two of the four open items below are settled, both negative
results, in [renderer.md](../../docs/ghidra/functions/ps3-hdfury-eu/renderer.md)
- "Per-texture sRGB/`GAMMA` decode: settled negative" and the paragraph
starting "One of these is now settled, one is not." **`0x1aaf7631` and
`colorSet1` are refuted as one attribute** (confidence 78: their fourth-byte
distributions differ, 255-on-every-vertex versus a 23%/66% split, over a
combined ~5 M vertices - the 297+54=351 chunk count only ever showed they are
*complementary*, never identical). **No per-texture gamma/sRGB control exists
anywhere in the engine's per-texture register set** (confidence 90, all ten
disc format bytes checked against `Texture_BuildGcmRegisters`'s `FILTER`-nibble
write) - and this does **not** settle the linear-vs-gamma question below,
contrary to what this file previously implied: input decode and output
encoding are different ends of the pipe.

## Open

- Whether the 8-bit surfaces hold linear or gamma light is undetermined (confidence 70 against ADR-0026, not acted on) - still open, unchanged by the above
- What the colour set's fourth byte gates is unknown - `0x1aaf7631` is declared by no `SHO` shader block, so the only place left to check is per-material microcode
- `shadowMapTex` is projected by the disc and unimplemented here

## Next Steps

- Sweep per-material microcode (`scripts/ps3-microcode.py`) for a read of `0x1aaf7631`'s fourth byte, to settle what it gates
- `shadowMapTex` remains unread; locate what projects it and whether the disc's shadow map is reachable from data already on disc
